## Logging

To enable logs in the console, set the environment variable:

```

For logging only in a specific service (e.g., provisioning), modify the variable as follows:
```sh
RUST_LOG=provisioning=info
```

To write logs in file we have to configure settings in settings.yml
```sh
logging:
  enabled: true
  path: /var/log/mecha-agent.log # File path to store logs based on level filter
  level: info

```
